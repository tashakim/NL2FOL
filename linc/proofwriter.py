Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual.

Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others.

We know that if a person has a pet, they care for that pet. Since Leo is Charlie's pet, Charlie cares for Leo. Therefore, Charlie does not like Leo but cares for Leo, so the second part of the conclusion is false, which means the entire conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse",

Since James is not provided with souvenirs, since all who attended the conference in person are provided with souvenirs, we know that James did not attend the conference in person.
